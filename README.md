Improbable's SpatialOS provides a way for developers to easily build multiplayer game worlds. However, a modern online game requires additional infrastructure around the game server itself.

 This repository provides a suite of example gRPC (with additional HTTP support) services, packages and images. The intention is to give you everything you need to start building online services to support your game, be it authentication, matchmaking, inventories or whatever else you can think of.

The intention is to be as unopinionated and generic as possible - you know best what your game requires. The primary language used is C#, but we provide our Protocol Buffer files too so you should be able to reimplement the services in whichever language you choose. The services support gRPC and HTTP.

We encourage you to create a fork of this repo so that you can make whichever customisations you desire; use this as a base, rather than a comprehensive one-size-fits-all solution.

## Prerequisites

This repo and its documentation assume very little prior knowledge of cloud infrastructure technologies. However, there are a few things you should install.

- [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) - required to build and run the C# services.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) - to build the images.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) - used to deploy services to a cloud Kubernetes instance.
- _(Optional)_ [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - useful for running the services locally.

We also recommend you set up a [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com) project. The services themselves are platform-agnostic and should run anywhere; however, the extra configuration we have provided for setting up the cloud infrastructure is Google-specific in places. It should be possible to port these configurations to run on AWS, Azure or another platform, but this is beyond the scope of this documentation.

## Getting started

We have a couple of different suggestions of where you could start.

- Want to get something up and running right away? Try our [Quickstart guide](./docs/quickstart.md). This will run you through getting our services running on your own cloud project.
- Read our [Gateway explainer](./docs/gateway/README.md). This runs through how the Gateway system works, and includes best practices for using it with your game.

## Included in this repo

Trying to find something quickly? Here is a list of services, packages and sample configuration files included in this repository.

### Services

A selection of deployable services for authentication, matchmaking and more.

#### Gateway

The client-facing interface to the matchmaking system. Exposes two gRPC services: the Gateway service and a [Long-running Operations](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/longrunning/operations.proto) service.

- [C# service](./services/csharp/Gateway)
- [Gateway proto definition](./services/proto/gateway/gateway.proto)
- [Long-running Operations proto definition](./services/proto/google/longrunning/operations.proto)

#### GatewayInternal

The Matcher-facing interface to the matchmaking system. Exposes a GatewayInternal gRPC service - with the default configuration this is only exposed to other services on the Kubernetes cluster.

- [C# service](./services/csharp/GatewayInternal)
- [Proto definition](./services/proto/gateway/gateway_internal.proto)

#### Party & Invite

A separate, but related, service to the matchmaking system. Provides operations for the management of parties and invites to those parties. Exposes Party and Invite gRPC services.

- [C# service](./services/csharp/Party)
- [Party proto definition](./services/proto/party/party.proto)
- [Invite proto definition](./services/proto/party/invite.proto)

#### PlayFab Auth

A simple authentication server which validates a provided PlayFab ticket and returns a Player Identity Token (PIT).

- [C# service](./services/csharp/PlayFabAuth)
- [Proto definition](./services/proto/auth/playfab.proto)

### Examples

A set of sample deployable containers, demonstrating how one might go about building different components.

#### Deployment Pool

A long-running process, deployed in your cluster, which will maintain a pull of ready-to-go deployments. Useful in session-based games where deployments are created and removed often.

- [Explainer](./docs/deployment-pool/README.md)
- [Usage guide](./docs/deployment-pool/usage.md)
- [C# source](./services/csharp/DeploymentPool)

#### Sample Matcher

A very naive Matcher implementation in C#. Useful for demoing the matchmaking system and for seeing the rough structure of how a Matcher is implemented.

- [C# source](./services/csharp/SampleMatcher)

#### Sample Client

A simple client which can be used to demo the PlayFab auth and matchmaking systems, or validate that they are working.

- [C# source](./services/csharp/SampleClient)

### Packages

All packages are namespaced with `Improbable.OnlineServices.*`. You can find these on NuGet if you like, but they're also included in this repo and imported as `ProjectReference`s in the example services.

#### Base.Server

A generic C# gRPC server. Provides convenience methods for mounting services and adding interceptors, as well as as logging and support for exporting metrics to a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) instance.

This package doesn't include anything Improbable-specific; you can use it for any C# server.

- [Source & documentation](./services/csharp/Base.Server/)
- [`Base.Server` package on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Improbable.OnlineServices.Base.Server)

#### Base.Matcher

A base class for implementing a Gateway [Matcher](./docs/Gateway.md#Matchers).

- [Source & documentation](./services/csharp/Base.Matcher/)
- [`Base.Matcher` package on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Improbable.OnlineServices.Base.Matcher)

#### Common

A collection of classes and utilities for building online services. This includes our data model, database client libraries, Platform SDK, PIT interceptors and more. Include this library if you're building an online service for a SpatialOS game.

- [Source & documentation](./services/csharp/Common)
- [`Common` on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Improbable.OnlineServices.Common)

#### Proto

A NuGet package of our compiled Protocol Buffers. Used to provide client or server interfaces for each of our APIs.

- [Source & documentation](./services/csharp/Proto)
- [`Proto` on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Improbable.OnlineServices.Proto)
