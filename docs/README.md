# The SpatialOS Metagame Services documentation on GitHub

This documentation on GitHub is a copy of the [Metagame Services section on the SpatialOS documentation website](https://docs.improbable.io/metagame/latest). Due to this, the internal links do not work and the image links are broken. 

We recommend you use the Metagame Services documentation on the SpatialOS documentation website and not on GitHub.
