# Database Sync Worker

The Database Sync Worker is a SpatialOS server-worker, which is designed to synchronize game data between SpatialOS and an external database.

For example, a player's data might contain persistent character unlocks, stats, and customization. When this data needs to be read and modified by SpatialOS server-workers, the data should be presented in the same way as all other SpatialOS data in terms of components, component updates, and commands. With the Database Sync Worker, you can ensure that your game's logic uses the same data models that are already established.

To learn more about this worker, check the [README](https://github.com/spatialos/database-sync-worker) on GitHub.

The tutorial walks you through integrating this worker in the Example Project and using it to store persistent data outside of a SpatialOS deployment.")%>
