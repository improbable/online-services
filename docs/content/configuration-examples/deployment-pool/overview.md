# Deployment pool: overview
<%(TOC)%>

This is a technical overview of the deployment pool module. This module is optional and is not required to use [SpatialOS](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest) or [the Gateway]({{urlRoot}}/content/services-packages/gateway/gateway).

To find out about terms used in this document and get an overview of SpatialOS terminology and its approach to setting game servers and hosting, you can see the concepts guides: </br>
(**Note:** If you are using the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal, there is a guide tailored to how SpatialOS works with Unreal.)

## What is the deployment pool?

The deployment pool module maintains game deployments in a ready-to-go state. It is useful if you want players to be able to jump into a game or between levels with minimal wait times, as initialising game worlds can sometimes take a few minutes. It implements a basic algorithm to do this: As deployments become used by players (i.e. no longer "ready-to-go"), new deployments are started to replace them. In this way, it always maintains a buffer of available deployments for players to join.

The pool is implemented as a long-running process. It periodically polls the [SpatialOS Platform APIs](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/platform-sdk/introduction) to find the current state of deployments in a project and takes actions to bring the state in line with expectations. The current actions are as follows:

| Action       | Purpose      |
|--------------|--------------|
| `create`     | Creates a new deployment for the pool. This is generated when there are fewer "ready-to-go" deployments than required. |
| `delete`     | Shuts down a running deployment. This is generated when a deployment is marked as "completed" and so is no longer required. A deployment puts itself in this state. |
| `update`     | Changes a deployment's metadata once a process has finished. This is usually generated when a deployment has finished starting up and can be transitioned to the "ready-to-go" state. |

## Use

See the [use guide]({{urlRoot}}/content/configuration-examples/deployment-pool/usage) for instructions on how to run the deployment pool.

## Algorithm

The deployment pool algorithm is very basic. It maintains a constant number of "ready-to-go" deployments and does not attempt to monitor player load or capacity and, as such, is susceptible to spikes in traffic. More advanced features will be implemented in the future.

The pool maintains its picture of deployment readiness using the Deployment Metadata service. The readiness annotations used are as follows:

| Readiness  | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `ready`     | A deployment can be used by players. |
| `starting`  | A deployment has been started but has not yet completed all start-up actions. |
| `in_use` | A deployment that has been marked by a Matcher as currently in-use by players. |
| `completed` | Added by the deployment itself to indicate that it has finished running. For example, once a game session is over. |
| `stopping`  | A deployment is in the process of being shut down. |

*Note: these readiness annotations are subject to change in future versions*

The algorithm is as follows:

* List all running deployments in a project
* Check for deployments with the `ready` annotation: These are available for players.
* Check for deployments with the `starting` annotation: These are in the process of becoming available.
* If the number of ready deployments + the number of starting deployments is less than the minimum required, start new deployments to fill the gap. These new deployments will have the `starting` annotation.
* Check the start-up state of deployments with the `starting` annotation. If the state is `healthy` according to the SpatialOS platform then replace the `starting` annotation with the `ready` annotation.
* Check for deployments with the `completed` annotation: These deployments have finished their game session and need shutting down.
* Wait for 10 seconds and repeat.

## Caveats

* The deployment pool is intentionally very basic and will not fit every use case out-of-the-box.
* Some deployments will require one full iteration to become `ready`. This can add up to 10 seconds to the start-up time.
* Spikes in player count will exhaust the Pool. As the Deployment Pool does not change the rate of deployment creation, the number of waiting players may keep increasing.
